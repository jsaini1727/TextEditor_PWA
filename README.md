# Text Editor

## User Story

```md
As a developer, I wanted to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use.
```

## Description

```md
On opening the text editor web application, I see a client server folder structure.
On running `npm run start` from the root directory, my application starts up the backend and serve the client
When I run the text editor application from my terminal, I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled 
using webpack and on running the webpack plugins I generate HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
When I open the text editor I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window the content in the text editor is saved with IndexedDB, 
and when I reopen the text editor after closing it the content in the text editor is retrieved from our IndexedDB.
If I click the Install button, my web application is downloaded as an icon on my desktop
